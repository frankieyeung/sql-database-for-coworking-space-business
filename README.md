A SQL database for co-working space business

Business Scenario: Our company owns two floors of a top-quality office building located in the Central district, which we have been using as a coworking space for the past three years. Currently, we use an Excel spreadsheet to keep track of bookings, and we rely on email to manage customer information and bookings. However, as our business is growing and expanding, we would like to streamline our processes by creating a database that will centralize all of our records, including information about our working space and other resources.

In our coworking space, customers can book a range of items, including a conference hall, small conference rooms, independent office rooms, leisure rooms, Android phones, iPhones, LCD projectors, portable PCs, iPads, laptops, and Macbooks. We need to be able to schedule each of these resources for specific periods, while avoiding any conflicting use of resources.

Management has requested reporting on resource utilization, so we need to keep track of all the resources and customer usage statistics. For example, we will track the most requested laptop and the most frequently booked customer. We will generate weekly, monthly, and yearly reports on resource utilization for further business analysis.

In addition to tracking resources and bookings, we also need to manage customer information, such as their contact details and address. We also need to keep track of staff information, including their job position and salary.

To solve any issues that may arise, we need to keep track of the start and return dates of each resource. We will also monitor the availability of remaining resources to ensure that we are always prepared for new bookings.
